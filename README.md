#  Cadmus
A logging framework based on a delegation pattern.

The intent is to provide a lightweight, simple, easy to use logging interface, which can then delegate the actual responsibility of the physcial logging to another delegate.

This allows libraries and projects to be developed, indepdently of the logging framework, which can then be implemented or changed at some point in the future without the remaining code become problematic
